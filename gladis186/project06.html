<h2> A Place I would like to visit </h2>   
<p class="place-description"> One place that I would really like to visit in the world is Bora Bora. I have seen other people on tv and other things go there and it looks like such a nice and peaceful place to go visit.    
The water there also looks very clean and light blue. Bora Bora looks like a place where you could disconnect yourself from the world for a while and just enjoy all the nature around. It also looks like a place where a lot of good memories could be made. Those are all the reason why I would like to visit Bora Bora. </p>

<h2> A person I admire (past or present) </h2>  
<p class="person-description"> One person whom I truly admire is Cameron Boyce. <span class="important-point">He was such a hard worker from a very young age, and he was full of potential, everything he put his mind to he could accomplish.</span> He also did his best to help as many people as he possibly could. He always made us laugh with his jokes   
on tv shows. He was also always full of positive energy. Even when he knew he was sick he did not let that stop him from doing his best.    
That is why when he died this summer it surprised a lot of people because he never let his medical condition get the best of him.   
Those are some of the reasons why I admire Cameron Boyce.</p>
