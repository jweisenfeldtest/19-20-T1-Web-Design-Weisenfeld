<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>A Place I Would Like to Visit</h2>
<p>I would love to walk the streets of London one day. See the lovely gray sky's raining peaceful showers. Stand before beautiful and historic monuments to the worlds once most powerful empire. Immerse myself if just for a moment in an entirely new culture and experiences.</p>
<!-- Another place I would love to visit would have to Venice, Italy -->

<h2>A Person I Admire<br/>(past or present)</h2>
<p>The person I admire most in this world is not a historic figure or a modern leader, but rather someone very close to me. My mother has always been a source of insperation for me to work hard acedmically and professionally. She is a strong willed and hard working person. Despite our clear differences in our personallities that often cause us to clash I have nothing, but respect for her. Not a lot of people can say they raised three children on their own while working full time, less so that actually succeeded in doing so, but my mom does so everyday.</p>
<!-- Just incase someone forgot what a mom was ;) -->
