<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>Pink Corsage</h4>
<p style="font-size:14px;">The pink corsage has a bright color scheme using both the pink roses and white baby's breath. Both of which are contrasted to the dark greens around and under the flowers. The overall feel of the arrangement is soft with the smooth petals, leaves and ribbon; although the baby's breath gives it a bumpy finish. There is no negative space in the arrangement due to how closely bound it was made, not unusal given it is a corsage. There is no defined shape or form, but line is shown traveling upwards using the baby's breath and is transfered to the triangular dift downwards with the roses.</p>
<h4>Red and White Corsage</h4>
<p style="font-size:14px;">A complementary color scheme is made using both red and green. Then contrasted by the white roses and equally white ribbion. The roses and ribbon both give the arrangement a softer look which is contrasted by the bumpy greens inbetween them. The arrangement has no form, but it does have an ovalish shape similar to a football. Line fortifys this notion based on curve like motion of the roses near the border of the arrangement. There is no negative space.</p>
<h4>Pale Pink Corsage</h4>
<p style="font-size:14px;">Here unlike the previous pink rose corsage we see a pastel or tinted pink meaning it is pink with added white. With the white near this one the contrast is not as much as previous arrangement instead it feels more monochromatic. The overall feel is soft visually from the smooth roses to ribbon and the equally soft white flower underneath the rose. There is no defined shape or form. Line is formed by the ribbon and rose traveling in straight lines from one ribbon end to the other. There is also some negative space around the ribbon and outer edges of the arrangement giving it a more feeling of freedom since it isn't as compact as the previous pieces.</p>
