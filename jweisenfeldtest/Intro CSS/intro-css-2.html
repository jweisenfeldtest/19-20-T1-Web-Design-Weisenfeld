      <h2>Please Slow Down!</h2>
      <p>Since inline styles have limited scope and do not separate content from presentation, their use is generally discouraged.  We won't be using inline styles much in this class.</p>
      <p>This file does not have an internal style, so the external style is applied to any elements that don't have inline style.</p>
