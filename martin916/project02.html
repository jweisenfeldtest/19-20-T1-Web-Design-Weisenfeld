<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>A Place I Would Like to Visit</h2>
		<p>A place I'd love to visit would be New York. Mostly for all the various stores, Nintendo World especially. The many tourist destinations and widespread landmarks would also be nice to see in person.</p>

<p>New York, <a href="https://www.nintendonyc.com/_ui/img/carousel/hero-images/1stfloorreg.jpg" target="_blank">Nintendo World Store</a>

<h2>A Person I Admire</h2>
</br>
	<p>Someone I admire is my math teacher from 7th grade, Mr. Diaz. Previously before I had him, I didn't exactly care much for school; yet the way he taught and how strict he was with work gave me a sort of epiphany. Since then I've always admired him, as he was the one who inspired me to <em>try</em>. 7th and 8th grade I remember fondly, since those were probably the only two years where I had a good grade in math, unlike highschool.</p>
