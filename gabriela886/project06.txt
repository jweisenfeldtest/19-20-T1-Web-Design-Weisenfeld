  <h2>A Place I would like to visit</h2>
  <p class="place-description"> I'd like to visit many places, given the fact that the world is big and there are many gorgeous places to explore. Venice would be a good choice. There are various canals and Renaissance palaces as well as Gothic buildings. Additionally, I'd like to visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"> Greece</a>, simply because it looks absolutely beautiful and it has so much interesting background information to it all.

  <!-- I would like to travel all around the world and explore more than just these places including Japan. --> </p>

  <h2>A Person I admire</h2> 
  <br />
  <p class="person-description"> 
  <p>I admire my mother very much because she is the kindest, most caring person I know. Also <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/keanu-reeves-the-matrix-john-wick/" target="_blank"> Keanu Reeves </a>, because of the same reasons. They are both very selfless. </p>
