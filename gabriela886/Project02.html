  <h1>Hello World!</h1> 
  <hr /> 
  <h2>A Place I Would Like to Visit</h2> 
  <p> I'd like to visit many places, given the fact that the world is big and there are many gorgeous places to explore. Venice would be a good choice. There are various canals and Renaissance palaces as well as Gothic buildings. Additionally, I'd like to visit <a href="https://www.leadabroad.com/lead/lead-greece/"> Greece</a>, simply because it looks absolutely beautiful and it has so much interesting background information to it all.</p> 
  <!-- I would like to travel all around the world and explore more than just these places including Japan. --> 
  <h2>A Person I Admire</h2> 
  <br /> 
  <p>I admire my mother very much because she is the kindest, most caring person I know. Also <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/keanu-reeves-the-matrix-john-wick/" target="_blank"> Keanu Reeves </a>, because of the same reasons. They are both very selfless. </p>
