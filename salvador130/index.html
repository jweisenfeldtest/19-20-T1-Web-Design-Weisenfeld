    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
    <!-- My second choice was Italy. -->
    <p>I would really like to travel to Australia. It is the only country that is also a continent. Australia's climate varies from arid, rainy, tropical, and cold in some areas. Australians speak English, making communication much easier. Lastly, Australia has unique wildlife that only exists there.</p>

    <h2>A person I admire <br />(past or present)</h2>
    <!-- Maybe I will change this to Albert Einstein? -->
    <p>If I could meet someone I admire, it would have to be Michael Jordan. He is considered by many to be the greatest basketball player ever to play the game. He helped his team win 6 NBA championships during the 1990s. Along with numerous accolades in basketball, Michael is also a successful businessman and one of the most highly marketed athletes in history.</p>
