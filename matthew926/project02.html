  <hr /> 
  <h2>A place I would like to visit.</h2> 
  <p>If i could visit anywhere i would probaly go to italy because it is where my ancestors have came from on my moms side of the family. They have really cool places to visit that have been in italy for hundred of years and meaning to them. Another thing is because they have some really good food and the restaurants are small almost like coffe shops. Finally the people and the cluture that are there are alot different than in america.</p>

Also he has many documentsrys about his work and how he started into science.
