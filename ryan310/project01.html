<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>A place i would like to visit</h2>

<p>A place i would like to visit is this place in Hawaii called bora bora because it a good place to go with your family. It has clear and clean ocean you could even see the fishes. If i were to go to bora bora i would go scuba diving and also experience the houses made of breadfruit tree. Also the one thing i want to try is surfing or kite surfing because i have never done it before in my life and i would like to try new things. It's also fun place to spend with your family as well.</p>
